      <b>When</b> cancer is discovered early, the prognosis is improved. Unfortunately,
      when cancer is discovered, about 50% of cases are already advanced. Early
      intervention may try to limit or prevent cancer development and lethality
      is achieved by early discovery of cancer or precancerous changes. There
      are many obstacles to be addressed to obtain earlier detection of all
      tumors. It is critical to comprehend who is most at risk for developing
      cancer. Ideas must be transformed into sensitive, focused early detection
      systems and adequately assessed to enable realistic clinical adoption.
      Individuals with cancer who obtain an earlier diagnosis experience better
      care, fewer side effects from their therapies, and an improved standard of
      life than those who receive a later diagnosis. This is in addition to
      knowing that they stand a higher chance of surviving

      A blood chemistry test quantifies the levels of specific chemicals that
      tissues and organs in the body emit into the blood. Metabolites,
      electrolytes, lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, including enzymes, are
      some of these compounds. Blood chemistry tests provide crucial information
      about the functionality of your liver, kidneys, and other organs. Blood
      levels of substances that are high or low can indicate a disease or the
      side effects of a medication

      The CBC (complete blood count) counts the number of platelets, white blood
      cells, and red blood cells in your blood. It also calculates your
      hematocrit (the percentage of blood made up of red blood cells), the size
      of your red blood cells, and the amount of hemoglobin in your red blood
      cells. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in your blood. The CBC
      is frequently included in regular health examination. It can aid in the
      diagnosis of various malignancies, particularly leukemias. Your health is
      tracked as well both during and after treatment with it.

      In samples of tissue, blood, bone marrow, or amniotic fluid, Cytogenetic
      analysis searches for chromosomal alterations. Broken, missing, altered,
      or additional chromosomes are examples of chromosomal alterations.
      Chromosome changes could be an indication of a genetic disorder or certain
      cancers. Cytogenetic analysis may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of
      cancer, to organize treatment, or to assess the way a course of treatment
      is working

      A blood sample is tested using a liquid biopsy procedure to check for
      cancer cells or tumor DNA fragments that might occasionally leak into the
      blood. A biopsy using liquid could help with cancer early diagnosis.
      Almost any region of the body can be used to collect tissue or cell
      samples. Depending on the location of the tumor and the suspected cancer
      kind, different samples are obtained. The entire organ may need to be
      removed in certain biopsies. Only surgeons are qualified to execute these.
      In other kinds of biopsies, tumor samples are removed using an endoscope,
      a flexible, illuminated tube inserted into the body. These biopsies can be
      carried out by other clinicians, although surgeons are typically the ones
      that carry them out.

      But these traditional methods have a limitation of its own such as: For
      CBC, Inaccurate results could be caused by certain medical disorders or
      issues with the blood sample. As a result of improper phlebotomy
      technique, a sample that is visibly clotted is improper for testing since
      it will artificially lower the platelet count and lead to unpredictable
      results in other areas. Conventional karyotyping or cytokinesis analysis
      limit is accuracy in detecting complicated aberrations, marker
      chromosomes, and cryptic abnormalities. An extracted tumor sample used in
      a solid biopsy is delivered to a lab for analysis. This method is not
      suitable for the diagnosis of high-risk individuals due to the
      invasiveness of the procedure, which makes it impossible to track the
      progression of cancer. A solid biopsy is an excision of a tumor sample
      that is delivered to a lab for analysis. This method is not suitable for
      the diagnosis of high-risk individuals due to the invasiveness of the
      procedure, which makes it impossible to track the progression of cancer.
      Imaging tests have some limitations and are not always very informative.
      For instance, diagnostic tests typically are unable to conclusively
      determine if a change is brought on by cancer. Imaging tests can detect
      vast clusters of cancer cells, but they cannot detect a single cancer cell
      or even a few cancer cells.

      Scientists in the areas of early biomarker identification and drug
      screening have raised questions about field-effect transistor (FET) type
      biosensing designs. The non-metalized gate dielectrics that cover the
      semiconductor material actively translate the biological changes on the
      surface when it is exposed to an electrolyte solution. Numerous studies
      have validated the capability of these novel instruments to detect
      different biomolecular analytes in real-time, extremely precise, specific,
      and label-free manners. Biomarkers are chemicals that noticeably change as
      cancer progresses. These molecules, which include proteins, nucleic acids,
      hormones, metabolites, isoenzymes, and metabolites, have significant
      therapeutic value. The presence, lack, or change in concentration of a
      particular cell biomarker frequently indicates cancer development. The
      discovery and quantification of these kinds of oncobiomarkers may help in
      the early detection and monitoring of disease development. The unique
      characteristics of field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensors, such as
      their simplicity in surface functionalization, label-free nature, and low
      power consumption during functioning, have given a lot of attention to the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the reason why FET is efficient: Sensitivity: Compared to
      conventional techniques, FET biosensors can detect cancer biomarkers at
      considerably lower concentrations. This enables earlier cancer
      identification, which can enhance patient outcomes. Speed: Compared to
      conventional techniques like histology, which can take days or weeks to
      obtain results, FET biosensors can deliver results in real-time. FET
      biosensors can be constructed to be compact and portable, which qualifies
      them for applications at the point of care. They can therefore be employed
      in isolated areas or in places with limited resources, where conventional
      approaches would not be feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding over the fact that, Over the past few decades, FET biosensor
      platforms have drawn a lot of interest, which has greatly increased the
      number of practical applications. In order to achieve highly selective,
      ultrasensitive biosensing performance, it is critical to highlight the
      various parameters and the difficulties they pose, including the setup of
      the device, method of measurement, and operational circumstances, surface
      stimulation with a target-specific bioreceptor/recognition element, and
      recognition of biomarkers for a particular disease, such as cancer.
