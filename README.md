# Learning
Here is where i store all the stuffs that i am currently learning

so I am starting web-dev from scratch, even though i am too late . i hope i enjoy the process :) 
and before i start this , i know i cant make everyone happy , i dont know why i always try to make everyone happy.
Its overwhelming and i am sorry i am writing this here :) , i have no where to vent , I am a terrible person , i dont deserve these 
beautiful people around me , I am arrogant and I hurt people because of my childish mistakes. I dont deserve this beautiful life.
